# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Update Notes
- Instead of writing md file whenver update, create docs/UPDATE.md if not exists and keep tracking release notes in there.
- Since it's update notes, date information should be included.
- If directory "docs" not exists, create one and create UPDATE.md.
- Since updates will be stacked, be as concise as possible.
- If there are updates occurring within same dates, aggregate them into one so that the viewers can see update notes per day.
